What is Machine Learning
========================

Two Definitions
---------------

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered.

1. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

2. Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

Two Broad Classifications
-------------------------
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:

Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
